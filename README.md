Board & Paul page on mobile view height is too much compared to about page. 


On about and every page, the top image should have the text readable.  the brightness or something needs to be fixed.

In about us (all) pages, the min height should be min-height: 600px for md view, not for other views.
This can be fixed by creaing a custom class.
